# Answer Generation Prompt

Your task is to execute a precise text classification analysis. Based on the provided interview excerpt, characterize the nature of the interviewee's response to the specified question. You are required to assign the response to exactly one of the nine categories listed below, strictly adhering to the definitions to distinguish between nuanced labels.

- Explicit: The information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form)
- Implicit: The information requested is given, but without being explicitly stated (not in the requested form)
- Dodging: Ignoring the question altogether
- Deflection: Starts on topic but shifts the focus and makes a different point than what is asked
- Partial/half-answer: Offers only a specific component of the requested information.
- General: The information provided is too general/lacks the requested specificity.
- Declining to answer: Acknowledge the question but directly or indirectly refusing to answer at the moment
- Claims ignorance: The answerer claims/admits not to know the answer themselves.
- Clarification: Does not provide the requested information and asks for clarification.

In your final response, you are required to substantiate your classification with a detailed analysis that explicitly links the interviewee's wording to the category definition.

To ensure the highest accuracy, you should critically evaluate your initial classification against the provided definitions to rule out potential misinterpretations or edge cases. Your final response should present your most refined conclusion, offering a definitive category supported by a faithful and transparent justification of your reasoning.

Your final response should be in the following format:

## Part of the interview

Q. Yet over the last several months, we've seen many members of your own party in Congress embroiled in one scandal or another and all too ready to blame somebody else, whether prosecutors or Democrats or even the media. So I'm wondering, why do you think it is so many people in your own party have failed to live up to the standards of the responsibility era?

A.If any person in any party fails to live up to high standards, they ought to be held to account, Richard. It's important for there to be trust in the Halls of Congress and in the White House and throughout government. People got to trust elected leaders in order for democracy to work to its fullest extent. And I fully expect people to be held to account if there's wrongdoing, just like I expect corporate executives to be held to account for wrongdoing, just like I expect people throughout our society to be held to account for wrongdoing.People do have to take responsibility for the decisions they make in life. I take responsibility for the decisions I make. I also understand that those of us in positions of responsibility have the duty to bring honor to the offices we hold. People don't have to agree with somebody's opinion—there's all kinds of opinions here—but in order to make this country work and to make democracy succeed, there's got to be high standards, and people must be held to account to achieve those standards.I thank you for your time. See you on the campaign trail.

# Verification Prompt

Your task is to critically evaluate the accuracy and reasoning of a text classification assignment. The "Part of the interview"  and "Question" consists of an interview question and an answer. The "Solution" is a proposed classification of that answer into specific categories (e.g., Explicit, Dodging, Deflection, etc.), accompanied by a rationale.

You must act as a strict adjudicator and determine whether the solution is **Correct** or **Incorrect** based on the following strict criteria:

- **Correct:** The classification label is indisputably the best fit according to the standard definitions. AND, the accompanying rationale provides robust textual evidence, explicitly linking the interviewee's specific wording to the category's criteria. It must successfully rule out other similar categories (e.g., distinguishing 'Dodging' from 'Deflection').
- **Incorrect:** The solution falls into ANY of the following failure modes:
  1. The label is objectively wrong.
  2. The label is plausible, but the reasoning is weak, generic, or fails to cite specific evidence.
  3. The analysis hallucinates information not present in the text.
  4. A broader category (e.g., 'Implicit') is chosen when a more specific one (e.g., 'Deflection') would be more accurate.

**Important Constraints:**

- Do not accept generic justifications. The solution must reference specific phrases or logic within the text.
- If the solution cites "Context" or "Intent," it must be grounded in the provided text, not assumed external knowledge.

Please carefully scrutinize the quality of the classification below. In your final response, present a detailed critique followed by your final verdict.

Your response should follow this format:

## Evaluation//Your final evaluation should start with this exact same markdown title

Here is my evaluation of the solution: //Your evaluation should start with this exact same phrase.
... //Your evaluation here. You are required to:

1. **Verify the Label:** Is this strictly the best category? Compare it against potential alternative labels.
2. **Audit the Reasoning:** Specifically analyze whether the cited evidence supports the label. For correct classifications, explain why the interpretation is sound. For errors, explain exactly where the logic diverges from the definitions or the text.

Based on my evaluation, the final verdict is: ... //Output strictly either "Correct" or "Incorrect"

## Solution (Proposed Classification)

## Analysis

Here is my analysis of the text classification task:

**Question summary:** The interviewer asks, “Why do you think it is so many people in your own party have failed to live up to the standards of the responsibility era?” The requested information is a causal explanation—reasons why numerous members of the interviewee’s party have fallen short of those standards.

**Answer summary:** The interviewee responds with a series of normative statements: “If any person in any party fails to live up to high standards, they ought to be held to account… It's important for there to be trust… I fully expect people to be held to account… People do have to take responsibility… there’s got to be high standards, and people must be held to account…” The response emphasizes the need for accountability, trust, and responsibility but offers no explanation of **why** the failures have occurred.

**Critical evaluation against each category definition:**

1. **Explicit** – The answer does **not** explicitly state any reason for the failures.
2. **Implicit** – No causal explanation is implied either; the statements are prescriptive (“ought to be held to account”) rather than diagnostic.
3. **Dodging** – The answer does not ignore the question entirely; it acknowledges the theme of high standards and failure, so it is not a complete disregard.
4. **Deflection** – The response **starts on topic** (“If any person in any party fails…”) but immediately **shifts the focus** to what should happen (holding people accountable, building trust, upholding standards) and **makes a different point**—about the importance of accountability and trust—instead of addressing the “why” that was asked. This matches the definition: *Starts on topic but shifts the focus and makes a different point than what is asked.*
5. **Partial/half‑answer** – No component of the requested causal information is provided; the answer gives no reasons, partial or otherwise.
6. **General** – While the statements are broad and lack specificity, the core issue is that they do **not** answer the “why” at all. The definition of *General* (“The information provided is too general/lacks the requested specificity”) assumes the answer still pertains to the requested topic; here the response pivots to a normative stance about accountability, which is a different point, making **Deflection** a more precise fit.
7. **Declining to answer** – The interviewee does not directly or indirectly refuse to answer; they engage with the subject matter but steer it elsewhere.
8. **Claims ignorance** – There is no admission of not knowing the answer.
9. **Clarification** – No request for clarification is made.

**Linking wording to the Deflection definition:**

- The opening clause, “If any person in any party fails to live up to high standards, they ought to be held to account,” acknowledges the topic of failure but instantly redirects to a prescription (what *ought* to happen).
- Subsequent sentences (“It's important for there to be trust…,” “People got to trust elected leaders…,” “I fully expect people to be held to account…”) continue to focus on the necessity of accountability and trust—a different point from the requested causal explanation.
- The concluding remarks about responsibility, honor, and high standards reinforce this shifted focus, never returning to the “why” of the original question.

Thus, after evaluating all categories and ruling out plausible alternatives, the response most accurately fits **Deflection**.

Based on my analysis, the final label should be: Deflection.
